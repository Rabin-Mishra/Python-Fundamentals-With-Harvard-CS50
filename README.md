## About

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python code examples and exercises, designed to help beginners and intermediate learners master Python programming. The content is based on the Python programming fundamentals covered in:

- **Harvard's CS50x** course, which introduces the foundational concepts of computer science and programming using Python.
- **W3Schools** Python tutorials, covering everything from the basics of syntax to advanced topics such as object-oriented programming.
- **Python Official Documentation**, providing real-world examples and in-depth explanations for various Python libraries, functions, and syntax.

## Course Sources

The repository includes Python code examples and exercises from the following sources:

1. **Harvard CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science**
   - A renowned introductory course that includes Python programming basics, algorithms, and data structures.
   - Covers topics such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and Python libraries.

2. **W3Schools Python Tutorials**
   - Offers a variety of examples ranging from the very basics (syntax, variables) to more advanced topics (file handling, modules, exception handling, etc.).
   - Includes simple examples and exercises to practice Python code.

3. **Python Official Documentation**
   - Direct links to the official Python documentation for each library and function used in the examples.
   - Helps you deepen your understanding of Python with explanations directly from the source.

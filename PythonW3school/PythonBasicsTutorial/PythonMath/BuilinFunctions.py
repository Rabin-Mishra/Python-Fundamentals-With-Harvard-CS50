'''
Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
Use of built-in functions like
min()
max()
abs()
pow()
'''
x = min(5, 10, 15)
y = max(20, 25, 5)

print(x)
print(y)
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

a = abs(-1.25)
print(a)
print(type(a))

# Return the value of 4 to the power of 3( same as 4*4*4)
b = pow(4, 3)
print(b)
print(type(b))
